# AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection System

 This project leverages the PlantVillage Dataset (Resized 224×224) to develop an AI-driven system for monitoring crop health. The dataset contains thousands of leaf images categorized as healthy or diseased, making it ideal for training and testing deep learning models in plant disease recognition.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset includes several plant species along with different disease types, such as:

* Tomato
* Potato
* Corn (Maize)
* Apple
* Grape
* Pepper
* Soybean
* Strawberry
Others
Each plant class contains images of both healthy and infected leaves, offering a diverse dataset for model training.


Project Objective:

The main goals of this system are to:

Automatically identify plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning models.

Provide early diagnosis to help farmers manage crop health efficiently.

Contribute to the development of smart agriculture and precision farming technologies.
